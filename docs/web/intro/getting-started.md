## What

This project is a proof of concept to show how NX could be used to orchestrate angular
and java projects.

Using the power of NX (caching, run-many, affected, etc) we can have a fast and
integrated development experience.

From a single command we can build, test, lint, format, etc all the projects in the
monorepo.
