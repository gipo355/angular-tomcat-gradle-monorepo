# TODO: possibly use only compose with 1 container with nodemon and tomcat
#
# this is a dev only compose file that will be used to start the services needed
# and provide live reload for the tomcat webapp by running npm run dev
#
# network mode exposes the service directly to the host, no mapping needed
# requires ports available on the host

services:
  jakarta-base-rest:
    build:
      dockerfile: ./dev.Dockerfile
    container_name: jakarta-base-rest
    env_file: ./.env.default
    develop:
      # watch allows to sync files from host to container
      # When we run npm run dev, it will start the container and build the war.
      # on every war change, it will sync the war to the container and tomcat automatically restarts the app
      watch:
        - action: sync+restart
          path: './build/libs/'
          target: '/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/'
    # for ease of use, we forward the tomcat port to the host
